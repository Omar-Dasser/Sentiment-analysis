# Overview

The present project has for goal to Analyse sentiments within a large datasets of Tweets, two mainly approaches were followed during this work.
The first approach, in the subfolder /tutorial, was to follow a Machine Learning paradigm where I used different algorithmes such as XGBoost, SVMs, Logistic regression ...
And the second approach, in the subfolder /DeepLearning, was to follow a Deep Learning approach where I used a Recurrent neural networks LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) architecture which proved to be the most efficient architecture to deal with text multi-class classification
